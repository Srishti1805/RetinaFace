This project focuses on implementing a state-of-the-art face detection system using the RetinaFace model. Based on the research paper "RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild," this model leverages deep learning techniques to achieve highly accurate and efficient face detection. RetinaFace stands out due to its robustness in detecting faces under various conditions, including occlusions, different angles, and varying lighting. By utilizing this model, our project aims to provide a reliable and fast face detection solution suitable for real-world applications.


## Step 1: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv
```
## Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Step 3: Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Run on images
```
python image.py --image-path <full-image_path>
```
